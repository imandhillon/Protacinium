Intent is to go on to add a cnn (or a few) to identify feaures of songs
based in music theory. I would like it to be able to identify elements in 
music, such as perhaps, instrument(s), time sigs, chord progression, 
note duration/bmp, and other musical elements and their relative 
placement in the song to keep stats on what
is 'valid' behavior: where the corpus (softly) determines the range of 'valid' with whatever 
specs are calculated for it. 
	Looking into Euclidean strings/algorithm.

		------------------
Note generation as described in this HW assignemnt from Stanford. I might just do the whole assignemnt
for the tools I would end up with in it.

		------------------
Switching over to pure tensorflow. Maybe to numpy at some point. If one is more efficient,
I will use that.
Doing the numpy thing so I can learn, regardless.
		------------------
Add functionality to sound swap.
		------------------
Add cnn to detect 'plagiarism' or overfitting. Allow user to rate output. 
Keep stats on user preferences.
